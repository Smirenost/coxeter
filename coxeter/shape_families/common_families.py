    This class generates the set of convex regular polygons with :math:`n`
    sides. The polygons are normalized to be unit area by default, and the
    initial vertex always lies on the x axis (so, for example, a 4-sided shape
    generated by this will look like a diamond, i.e. a square rotated by 90
    degrees).

    The following parameters are required by this class:
